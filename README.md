# 📺 KOL Finder 

This tool searches YouTube for channels related to one or more keywords, filters them by subscriber count and country, and extracts **each channel’s latest video date + views** — all while minimizing YouTube API quota usage.

✔ Multi-keyword search (from file)  
✔ Filter by subscriber count  
✔ Optional country filter (ISO format, e.g., `US`, `JP`)  
✔ Low-quota design (uses `activities.list`, avoids expensive `search.list`)  
✔ CSV export  
✔ Limit number of processed channels  
✔ Hard-coded API key supported
