Hey there! My name is Mark, but most people know me on the internet as Goodgis.

I’m a full-time Graphic Designer who makes video games and shares my adventures on Youtube. I specialize in making cute, colorful games and am currently working on a Metroidvania called Dewdrop Dynasty.

I also run my own little game studio called Firith Studio. It's been my dream, ever since I was a kid, to hire my friends and make Firith Studio a full-time job. And it's crazy to think that every day I get a little bit closer to that goal.

I’m probably most known for games such as The Keeyp, Wizbirds Online, Blizzard Blowout 64, and of course Dewdrop Dynasty. Wishlist on Steam!

Many of us have had the thought of making a game at one point in our life. Most of us have amazing and creative ideas, but making a game is a long haul that takes time and discipline. Plus, for most of us, it requires a whole new skill set to develop.

On this channel I help you with that challenge, that journey, to make your own game. We focus on the Godot Game Engine, the third most popular, and quickly growing, game engine at the moment. Also, you will find some general game theory, or project management tutorials pop-up from time to time.

Have fun watching the tutorials and let me know what you think!
