Just pure glossy perfection. 💡 With one simple trick, your ASA and ABS 3D prints can go from “obviously 3D printed” to “did that come out of an injection mold?”  In this video I show you exactly how I acetone vapor smooth my 3D prints so the layer lines vanish and the surface shines. It is easy to set up and the results are insane.  Here is what you need to follow along: • 🧲 Magnets • 🧻 Paper towels • 🫙 A container that can handle acetone (mine is certified plastic but glass works too) • ⬆ A small platform to raise your prints • 💧 Acetone • 🥽 Gloves and safety glasses  Step-by-step:  Hang the paper towels inside the container with magnets.  Place your models on the raised platform so vapor can wrap evenly around them.  Pour acetone onto the paper towels carefully, avoiding drips on the prints.  Let the vapor do its work. This can take 10 minutes or several hours depending on how glossy you want them. Mine stayed in for 5 hours.  Let the prints rest for a couple of hours after smoothing so they fully harden again.  ✨ The results: ASA and ABS came out at a perfect 10 out of 10 on the smoothness scale. They look professionally made with zero visible layer lines.  ⚠ Safety first: acetone vapors are not to be messed with. Always work in a well ventilated space and keep away from sparks or flames.  This technique is a game changer for cosplay props, display pieces, and any functional part that needs a clean, professional look.

natan_mohart,Natan Mohart | Personal Growth & Mindset,DQbne55DGs-,https://www.instagram.com/p/DQbne55DGs-/,"10 Mental Traps That Quietly Control Your Thinking  Our brain is not a tool for truth, it is a tool for survival. It doesn’t look for what’s right, it looks for what’s fast.  Every decision passes through hidden filters. They save energy but distort perception.  That’s why smart people make stupid mistakes. Not because they’re stupid, but because they’re human.  Here are 10 traps we all fall into:  1. Confirmation Bias ↳ you only notice what confirms your beliefs.  2. Dunning–Kruger Effect ↳ the less you know, the more confident you feel.  3. Sunk Cost Fallacy ↳ you keep going simply because you’ve already invested.  4. Negativity Bias ↳ one bad event outweighs ten good ones.  5. Anchoring Bias ↳ the first number or idea distorts everything that follows.  6. Halo Effect ↳ charisma makes you believe in competence.  7. Authority Bias ↳ you trust confidence, not accuracy.  8. Availability Heuristic ↳ what’s easier to recall feels more true.  9. Groupthink ↳ you stay silent to fit in.  10. Survivorship Bias ↳ you study the winners and forget the ones who didn’t make it.  Our brain was built to survive, not to understand. Awareness is the only way out of this game.  Below is the infographic with a deeper breakdown of each trap, with examples and simple ways to spot and neutralize them.  💬 Which of these traps do you fall for most often?  — @natan_mohart",

thezamizafar,Zumar | AI & Design,DQYZrDNCNTZ,https://www.instagram.com/p/DQYZrDNCNTZ/,"Comment “Formula” if you want the client flow formula.  Sometimes we get so caught up mastering every AI tool, learning new techniques, and creating things that actually look incredible yet still, finding clients feels harder than building what we create. It’s not that we aren’t good enough; it’s that somewhere along the way, we forget to define what problem we truly solve.  Clients don’t buy tools they buy clarity. They care about transformation, not the process. We can have the most advanced AI setups, but if our direction is off and we’re not showing the result we bring, everything starts to blend into the noise.  The truth is, talent without a system ends up relying on luck. We can be highly skilled, but without a simple structure — a clear offer, consistent outreach, honest follow-ups, and a smooth delivery process consistency never sticks.  When we shift from showing tools to showing transformation, when our message focuses on the outcome instead of the method, that’s when clients begin to lean in.   They stop seeing us as just “AI creators” and start recognizing us as people who can actually solve their problems.  Clarity creates clients. Systems keep them coming.  #generativeai #promptengineering #findclients #aitool #aicreator #aiartist #aicontentcreator #aimarketing #aivisuals #aidesign #aifreelancer",

Draw a mask over it, turn on the 3D switch, and add stroke effect on it.  Step 2- By rotating the shapes inwards, create a 3D crystal-like shape; the points of each shape should be connected. Make a similar crystal but with a fill in another comp.  Step 3- Duplicate both stroke and fill comps and link both of them to a Null object, and flip it to form a whole crystal.  Step 4- Add 2 point lights to give some depth and a crystal-like hue.  Step 5- Add roughen edges to the stroke comp and change the blending mode to overlay.  Step 6- Add a Deep glow to the crystal using an adjustment layer.   Step 7- Add Twinkly sparkles to the crystal to give it a shinier look.  The Anime Crystal Is Ready!!!!  Try creating by yourself!

Step-By-Step Guide on:  How to create a 3D Anime Crystal in Adobe After Effects?  Step 1- Create a crystal shape using the pen tool. Draw a mask over it, turn on the 3D switch, and add stroke effect on it.  Step 2- By rotating the shapes inwards, create a 3D crystal-like shape; the points of each shape should be connected. Make a similar crystal but with a fill in another comp.  Step 3- Duplicate both stroke and fill comps and link both of them to a Null object, and flip it to form a whole crystal.  Step 4- Add 2 point lights to give some depth and a crystal-like hue.  Step 5- Add roughen edges to the stroke comp and change the blending mode to overlay.  Step 6- Add a Deep glow to the crystal using an adjustment layer.   Step 7- Add Twinkly sparkles to the crystal to give it a shinier look.  The Anime Crystal Is Ready!!!!  Try creating by yourself!

natan_mohart,Natan Mohart | Personal Growth & Mindset,DQbne55DGs-,https://www.instagram.com/p/DQbne55DGs-/,"10 Mental Traps That Quietly Control Your Thinking  Our brain is not a tool for truth, it is a tool for survival. It doesn’t look for what’s right, it looks for what’s fast.  Every decision passes through hidden filters. They save energy but distort perception.  That’s why smart people make stupid mistakes. Not because they’re stupid, but because they’re human.  Here are 10 traps we all fall into:  1. Confirmation Bias ↳ you only notice what confirms your beliefs.  2. Dunning–Kruger Effect ↳ the less you know, the more confident you feel.  3. Sunk Cost Fallacy ↳ you keep going simply because you’ve already invested.  4. Negativity Bias ↳ one bad event outweighs ten good ones.  5. Anchoring Bias ↳ the first number or idea distorts everything that follows.  6. Halo Effect ↳ charisma makes you believe in competence.  7. Authority Bias ↳ you trust confidence, not accuracy.  8. Availability Heuristic ↳ what’s easier to recall feels more true.  9. Groupthink ↳ you stay silent to fit in.  10. Survivorship Bias ↳ you study the winners and forget the ones who didn’t make it.  Our brain was built to survive, not to understand. Awareness is the only way out of this game.  Below is the infographic with a deeper breakdown of each trap, with examples and simple ways to spot and neutralize them.  💬 Which of these traps do you fall for most often?  — @natan_mohart",

You’ll see a simple box where you can type in your presentation topic. It could be anything—a school project, a business pitch, or even a fun idea for a party.  Once you enter your topic, the AI gets to work. It drafts an outline for you. This outline is not set in stone. You can edit it however you like. Want to add a point? Go for it. Want to remove something? Easy.  Next up, pick a theme. There are plenty to choose from. Whether you want something sleek and professional or colorful and fun, there’s a theme for you.  Then, hit generate. Just like that, your presentation is ready! It includes all the content, images, and animations you need.   I remember when I first tried it for a school project.

thezamizafar,Zumar | AI & Design,DQYZrDNCNTZ,https://www.instagram.com/p/DQYZrDNCNTZ/,"Comment “Formula” if you want the client flow formula.  Sometimes we get so caught up mastering every AI tool, learning new techniques, and creating things that actually look incredible yet still, finding clients feels harder than building what we create. It’s not that we aren’t good enough; it’s that somewhere along the way, we forget to define what problem we truly solve.  Clients don’t buy tools they buy clarity. They care about transformation, not the process. We can have the most advanced AI setups, but if our direction is off and we’re not showing the result we bring, everything starts to blend into the noise.  The truth is, talent without a system ends up relying on luck. We can be highly skilled, but without a simple structure — a clear offer, consistent outreach, honest follow-ups, and a smooth delivery process consistency never sticks.  When we shift from showing tools to showing transformation, when our message focuses on the outcome instead of the method, that’s when clients begin to lean in.   They stop seeing us as just “AI creators” and start recognizing us as people who can actually solve their problems.  Clarity creates clients. Systems keep them coming.  #generativeai #promptengineering #findclients #aitool #aicreator #aiartist #aicontentcreator #aimarketing #aivisuals #aidesign #aifreelancer",
